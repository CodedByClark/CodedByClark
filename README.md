### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Daniel Clark from Arkansas, and I'm a Python enthusiast who is wanting to learn more about web development. I currently work as a Project Manager in the Renewable Energy Industry, and enjoy using Python for process improvement and automating daily tasks. I previously served in the United States Army as both a Signal Officer and Armor Officer, but transitioned to the Inactive Reserves in 2018.

You can check out the Python videos and web development videos at my Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyCy7R0Vj4QSU0XyQZBvvkQ

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on uploading a portfolio of Python projects to Github and my Youtube Channel
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Python and eventually web development
